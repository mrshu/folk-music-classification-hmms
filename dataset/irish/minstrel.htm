<b>
The Minstrel Boy to the war is gone<br>
In the ranks of death you will find him<br>
His father's sword he hath girded on<br>
And his wild harp slung behind him<br>
"Land of Song!" said the warrior bard<br>
"Tho' all the world betrays thee<br>
One sword, at least, they rights shall guard<br>
One faithful harp shall praise thee!"<p>

The Minstrel fell! But the foeman's chain<br>
Could not bring that proud soul under<br>
The harp he lov'd ne'er spoke again<br>
For he tore its chords asunder<br>
And said "No chains shall sully thee<br>
Thou soul of love and brav'ry!<br>
Thy songs were made for the pure and free, <br>
They shall never sound in slavery!"
