<b>
My young love said to me, "My mother won't mind<br>
And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind."<br>
And she stepped away from  me and this she did say<br>
It will not be long, love, till our wedding day."<p>

As she stepped away from me and she moved through the fair<br>
And fondly I watched her move here and move there<br>
And then she turned homeward with one star awake<br>
Like the swan in the evening moves over the lake.<p>

The people were saying, no two e'er were wed<br>
But one had a sorrow that never was said<br>
And I smiled as she passed with her goods and her gear<br>
And that was the last that I saw of my dear.<p>

Last night she came to me, my dead love came in<br>
So softly she came that her feet made no din<br>
As she laid her hand on me and this she did say<br>
"It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day."<br>
