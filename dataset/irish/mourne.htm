Oh Mary this London's a wonderful sight<br>
With people here workin' by day and by night<br>
They don't sow potatoes, nor barley, nor wheat<br>
But there's gangs of them diggin' for gold in the street<br>
At least when I asked them that's what I was told<br>
So I just took a hand at this diggin' for gold<br>
But for all that I found there I might as well be<br>
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.<p>

I believe that when writin' a wish you expressed<br>
As to how the fine ladies in London were dressed<br>
Well if you'll believe me, when asked to a ball<br>
They don't wear no top to their dresses at all<br>
Oh I've seen them meself and you could not in truth<br>
Say that if they were bound for a ball or a bath<br>
Don't be startin' them fashions, now Mary McCree<br>
Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.<p>

There's beautiful girls here, oh never you mind<br>
With beautiful shapes nature never designed<br>
And lovely complexions all roses and cream<br>
But let me remark with regard to the same<br>
That if that those roses you venture to sip<br>
The colors might all come away on your lip<br>
So I'll wait for the wild rose that's waitin' for me<br>
In the place where the dark Mourne sweeps down to the sea.<br>
