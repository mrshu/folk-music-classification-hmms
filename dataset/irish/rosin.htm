<b>
I've traveled all over this world<br>
And now to another I go<br>
And I know that good quarters are waiting<br>
To welcome old Rosin the Beau<br>
To welcome old Rosin the Beau<br>
To welcome old Rosin the Beau<br>
And I know that good quarters are waiting<br>
To welcome old Rosin the Beau.<p>
When I'm dead and laid out on the counter<br>
A voice you will hear from below<br>
Saying "Send down a hogshead of whiskey<br>
To drink with old Rosin the Beau"<br>
To drink with old Rosin the Beau"<br>
To drink with old Rosin the Beau"<br>
Saying "Send down a hogshead of whiskey<br>
To drink with old Rosin the Beau".<p>

Then get a half dozen stout fellows<br>
And stack them all up in a row<br>
Let them drink out of half gallon bottles<br>
To the memory of Rosin the Beau<br>
To the memory of Rosin the Beau<br>
To the memory of Rosin the Beau<br>
Let them drink out of half gallon bottles<br>
To the memory of Rosin the Beau.<p>

Then get this half dozen stout fellows<br>
And let them all stagger and go<br>
And dig a great hole in the meadow<br>
And in it put Rosin the Beau<br>
And in it put Rosin the Beau<br>
And in it put Rosin the Beau<br>
And dig a great hole in the meadow<br>
And in it put Rosin the Beau.<p>

Then get ye a couple of bottles<br>
Put one at me head and me toe<br>
With a diamond ring scratch upon them<br>
The name of old Rosin the Beau<br>
The name of old Rosin the Beau<br>
The name of old Rosin the Beau<br>
With a diamond ring scratch upon them<br>
The name of old Rosin the Beau.<p>

I've only this one consolation<br>
As out of this world I go<br>
I know that the next generation<br>
Will resemble old Rosin the Beau<br>
Will resemble old Rosin the Beau<br>
Will resemble old Rosin the Beau<br>
I know that the next generation<br>
Will resemble old Rosin the Beau.<p>

I fear that old tyrant approaching<br>
That cruel remorseless old foe<br>
And I lift up me glass in his honor<br>
Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau<br>
Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau<br>
Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau<br>
And I lift up me glass in his honor<br>
Take a drink with old Rosin the Beau.</b>
