<b>
Oh, a wan cloud was drawn o'er the dim weeping dawn<br>
As to Shannon's side I return'd at last<br>
And the heart in my breast for the girl I lov'd best<br>
Was beating, ah, beating, loud and fast!<br>
While the doubts and the fears of the long aching years<br>
Seem'd mingling their voices with the moaning flood<br>
Till full in my path, like a wild water wrath<br>
My true love's shadow lamenting stood.<p>

But the sudden sun kiss'd the cold, cruel mist<br>
Into dancing show'rs of diamond dew<br>
And the dark flowing stream laugh'd back to his beam<br>
And the lark soared aloft in the blue<br>
While no phantom of night but a form of delight<br>
Ran with arms outspread to her darling boy<br>
And the girl I love best on my wild throbbing breast<br>
Hid her thousand treasures with cry of joy.<p>

And the girl I love best on my wild throbbing breast<br>
Hid her thousand treasures with cry of joy.
