<center><h2>The Rose Of Tralee</h2></center>
<b>
The pale moon was rising above the green mountain<br>
The sun was declining beneath the blue sea<br>
When I strayed with my love to the pure crystal fountain<br>
That stands in beautiful vale of Tralee.<br>
She was lovely and fair as the rose of the summer<br>
Yet, 'twas not her beauty alone that won me<br>
Oh no! 'Twas the the truth in her eye ever beaming<br>
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.<p>

The cool shades of evening their mantle were spreading<br>
And Mary all smiling was listening to me<br>
The moon through the valley her pale rays was shedding<br>
When I won the heart of the Rose of Tralee.<br>
Though lovely and fair as the rose of the summer<br>
Yet, 'twas not her beauty alone that won me<br>
Oh no! 'Twas the the truth in her eye ever beaming<br>
That made me love Mary, the Rose of Tralee.
