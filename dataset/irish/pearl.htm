<b>
There's a colleen fair as May<br>
For a year and for a day<br>
I have sought by every way<br>
Her heart to gain.<br>
There's no art of tongue or eye<br>
Fond youths with maidens try<br>
But I've tried with ceaseless sigh<br>
Yet tried in vain.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If to France or far off Spain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She crossed the wat'ry main<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see her face again the seas I'd brave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if it's heaven's decree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mine she'll never be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the Son of Mary me in mercy save.<p>

But a kiss with welcome bland<br>
And the touch of thy fair hand<br>
Are all that I demand<br>
Would'st thou not spurn<br>
For if not mine, dear girl<br>
My snowy breasted pearl<br>
May I never from the fair<br>
With life return.
