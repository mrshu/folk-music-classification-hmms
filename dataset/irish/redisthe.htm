<b>
Come over the hills, my bonnie Irish lass<br>
Come over the hills to your darling<br>
You choose the rose, love, and I'll make the vow<br>
And I'll be your true love forever.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Red is the rose that in yonder garden grows<br>
Fair is the lily of the valley<br>
Clear is the water that flows from the Boyne<br>
But my love is fairer than any.</i><p>

'Twas down by Killarney's green woods that we strayed<br>
When the moon and the stars they were shining<br>
The moon shone its rays on her locks of golden hair<br>
And she swore she'd be my love forever.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

It's not for the parting that my sister pains<br>
It's not for the grief of my mother<br>
'Tis all for the loss of my bonny Irish lass<br>
That my heart is breaking forever.<p>

<i>Chorus</i>
