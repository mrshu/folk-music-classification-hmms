"O Paddy dear, and did ye hear the news that's goin' round?<br>
The shamrock is by law forbid to grow on Irish ground!<br>
No more Saint Patrick's Day we'll keep, his color can't be seen<br>
For there's a cruel law ag'in the Wearin' o' the Green."<p>

I met with Napper Tandy, and he took me by the hand<br>
And he said, "How's poor old Ireland, and how does she stand?"<br>
"She's the most distressful country that ever yet was seen<br>
For they're hanging men and women there for the Wearin' o' the Green."<p>

"So if the color we must wear be England's cruel red<br>
Let it remind us of the blood that Irishmen have shed<br>
And pull the shamrock from your hat, and throw it on the sod<br>
But never fear, 'twill take root there, though underfoot 'tis trod.<p>

When laws can stop the blades of grass from growin' as they grow<br>
And when the leaves in summer-time their color dare not show<br>
Then I will change the color too I wear in my caubeen<br>
But till that day, please God, I'll stick to the Wearin' o' the Green."
