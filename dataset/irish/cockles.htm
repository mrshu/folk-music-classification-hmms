<b>

In Dublin's fair city, where the girls are so pretty<br>

I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone<br>

As she wheeled her wheel-barrow<br>

Through streets broad and narrow<br>

Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O!<br>

Alive, alive-O! alive, alive-O!<br>

Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O!<p>



She was a fish-monger, but sure 'twas no wonder<br>

For so were her father and mother before<br>

And they each wheeled their barrow<br>

Through streets broad and narrow<br>

Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O!<br>

Alive, alive-O! alive, alive-O!<br>

Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O!<p>



She died of a fever, and no one could save her<br>

And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone<br>

But her ghost wheels her barrow<br>

Through streets broad and narrow<br>

Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O!<br>

Alive, alive-O! alive, alive-O!<br>

Crying cockles and mussels, alive, alive-O!<p>
