Oh Bridgit O’Malley, you left my heart shaken<br>
With a hopeless desolation, I’d have you to know<br>
It’s the wonders of admiration your quiet face has taken<br>
And your beauty will haunt me wherever I go.<p>

The white moon above the pale sands, the pale stars above the thorn tree<br>
Are cold beside my darling, but no purer than she<br>
I gaze upon the cold moon till the stars drown in the warm sea<br>
And the bright eyes of my darling are never on me.<p>

My Sunday it is weary, my Sunday it is grey now<br>
My heart is a cold thing, my heart is a stone<br>
All joy is dead within me, my life has gone away now<br>
For another has taken my love for his own.<p>

The day it is approaching when we were to be married<br>
And it’s rather I would die than live only to grieve<br>
Oh meet me, my Darling, e’er the sun sets o’er the barley<br>
And I’ll meet you there on the road to Drumslieve.<p>

Oh Bridgit O’Malley, you’ve left my heart shaken<br>
With a hopeless desolation, I’d have you to know<br>
It’s the wonders of admiration your quiet face has taken<br>
And your beauty will haunt me wherever I go.
