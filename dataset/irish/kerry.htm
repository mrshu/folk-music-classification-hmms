<i>Chorus<br>
Oh, the days of the Kerry dancing<br>
Oh, the ring of the piper's tune<br>
Oh, for one of those hours of gladness<br>
Gone, alas, like our youth, too soon!</i><p>

When the boys began to gather<br>
In the glen of a summer's night<br>
And the Kerry piper's tuning<br>
Made us long with wild delight!<br>
Oh, to think of it<br>
Oh, to dream of it<br>
Fills my heart with tears!<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

Was there ever a sweeter Colleen<br>
In the dance than Eily More<br>
Or a prouder lad than Thady<br>
As he boldly took the floor.<p>

Lads and lasses to your places<br>
Up the middle and down again<br>
Ah, the merry hearted laughter<br>
Ringing through the happy glen!<br>
Oh, to think of it<br>
Oh, to dream of it<br>
Fills my heart with tears!<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

Time goes on, and the happy years are dead<br>
And one by one the merry hearts are fled<br>
Silent now is the wild and lonely glen<br>
Where the bright glad laugh will echo ne'er again<br>
Only dreaming of days gone by in my heart I hear.<p>

Loving voices of old companions<br>
Stealing out of the past once more<br>
And the sound of the dear old music<br>
Soft and sweet as in days of yore.<p>
When the boys began to gather<br>
In the glen of a summer's night<br>
And the Kerry piper's tuning<br>
Made us long with wild delight!<br>
Oh, to think of it<br>
Oh, to dream of it<br>
Fills my heart with tears!<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>
