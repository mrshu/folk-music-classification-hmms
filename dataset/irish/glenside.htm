<b>
'Twas down by the glenside, I met an old woman<br>
She was picking young nettles and she scarce saw me coming<br>
I listened a while to the song she was humming<br>
Glory O, Glory O, to the bold Fenian men.<p>

'Tis fifty long years since I saw the moon beaming<br>
On strong manly forms and their eyes with hope gleaming<br>
I see them again, sure, in all my daydreaming<br>
Glory O, Glory O, to the bold Fenian men.<p>

Some died on the glenside, some died near a stranger<br>
And wise men have told us that their cause was a failure<br>
They fought for old Ireland and they never feared danger<br>
Glory O, Glory O, to the bold Fenian men.<p>

I passed on my way, God be praised that I met her<br>
Be life long or short, sure I'll never forget her<br>
We may have brave men, but we'll never have better<br>
Glory O, Glory O, to the bold Fenian men.
