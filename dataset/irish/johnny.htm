While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo<br>
While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo<br>
While goin' the road to sweet Athy<br>
A stick in me hand and a drop in me eye<br>
A doleful damsel I heard cry,<br>
Johnny I hardly knew ye.<p>

With your drums and guns and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo<br>
With your drums and guns and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo<br>
With your drums and guns and drums and guns<br>
The enemy nearly slew ye<br>
Oh my darling dear, Ye look so queer<br>
Johnny I hardly knew ye.<p>

Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo<br>
Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo<br>
Where are your eyes that were so mild<br>
When my heart you so beguiled<br>
Why did ye run from me and the child<br>
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.<p>

Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo<br>
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo<br>
Where are your legs that used to run<br>
When you went for to carry a gun<br>
Indeed your dancing days are done<br>
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye.<p>

I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo<br>
I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo<br>
I'm happy for to see ye home<br>
All from the island of Sulloon<br>
So low in flesh, so high in bone<br>
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.<p>

Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo<br>
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo<br>
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg<br>
Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg<br>
Ye'll have to put with a bowl out to beg<br>
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye.<p>

They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo<br>
They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo<br>
They're rolling out the guns again<br>
But they never will take our sons again<br>
No they never will take our sons again<br>
Johnny I'm swearing to ye.
