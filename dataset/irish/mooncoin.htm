<b>
How sweet is to roam by the sunny Shure stream<br>
And hear the doves coo 'neath the morning sunbeam<br>
Where the thrush and the robin their sweet notes entwine<br>
On the banks of the Shure that flows down by Mooncoin.<p>

Flow on, lovely river, flow gently along<br>
By your waters so sweet sounds the lark's merry song<br>
On your green banks I wander where first I did join<br>
With you, lovely Molly, the rose of Mooncoin.<p>

Oh Molly, dear Molly, it breaks my fond heart<br>
To know that we two forever must part<br>
I'll think of you Molly while sun and moon shine<br>
On the banks of the Shure that flows down by Mooncoin.<p>

Then here's to the Shure with its valley so fair<br>
As oftimes we wandered in the cool morning air<br>
Where the roses are blooming and lilies entwine<br>
On the banks of the Shure that flows down by Mooncoin.<p>

Flow on, lovely river, flow gently along<br>
By your waters so sweet sounds the lark's merry song<br>
On your green banks I wander where first I did join<br>
With you, lovely Molly, the rose of Mooncoin.
