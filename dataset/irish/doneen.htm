<b>
You may travel far far from your own native land<br>
Far away o'er the mountains, far away o'er the foam<br>
But of all the fine places that I've ever been<br>
Sure there's none can compare with the cliffs of Doneen.<p>

Take a view o'er the mountains, fine sights you'll see there<br>
You'll see the high rocky mountains o'er the west coast of Clare<br>
Oh the town of Kilkee and Kilrush can be seen<br>
From the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Doneen.<p>

It's a nice place to be on a fine summer's day<br>
Watching all the wild flowers that ne'er do decay<br>
Oh the hares and lofty pheasants are plain to be seen<br>
Making homes for their young round the cliffs of Doneen.<p>

Fare thee well to Doneen, fare thee well for a while<br>
And to all the kind people I'm leaving behind<br>
To the streams and the meadows where late I have been<br>
And the high rocky slopes round the cliffs of Doneen.
