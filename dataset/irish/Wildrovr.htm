<b>
I've been a wild rover for many's a year<br>
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer<br>
And now I'm returnin' with gold in great store<br>
And I never will play the wild rover no more.<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
And it's No! Nay! Never!<br>
No nay never no more<br>
And I'll play the wild rover<br>
No never no more.</i><p>

I went to an alehouse I used to frequent<br>
And I told the landlady my money was spent<br>
I asked her for credit, she answered me nay<br>
Saying, "Custom like yours I can have any day!"<p>

I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright<br>
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight<br>
She said, "I have whiskeys and wines of the best<br>
And the words that I told you were only in jest."<p>

I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done<br>
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son<br>
And when they have kissed me as oft-times before<br>
I never will play the wild rover no more.
