<b>
As I roved out one morning<br>
Near the verdant braes of Skreen<br>
I put my back to the mossy tree<br>
To view the dew on the West Countrie<br>
The dew on the foreign strand.<p>

O sit ye down on the grass, he said<br>
On the dewy grass so green<br>
For the wee birds all have come and gone<br>
Since I my true love seen, he said<br>
Since I my true love seen.<p>

O I'll not sit on the grass, she said<br>
No lover I'll be of thine<br>
For I hear you love a Connaught maid<br>
And your heart's no longer mine, she said<br>
And your heart's no longer mine.<p>

O I will climb a high high tree<br>
And I'll rob a wild bird's nest<br>
And back I'll bring what I find there<br>
To the arms that I love best, he said<br>
To the arms that I love best.
