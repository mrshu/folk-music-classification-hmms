'Twas pretty to be in Ballinderry,<br>
'Twas pretty to be in Aghalee<br>
Still prettier to be on bonny Ram's Island<br>
Sitting forever beneath a tree.<p>

For often I sailed to bonny Ram's Island,<br>
Arm in arm with Phelim, my diamond<br>
And he would whistle and I would sing,<br>
And we would make the whole island ring.<p>

"I'm going," he said, "from bonny Ram's Island<br>
Out and across the deep blue sea,<br>
And if in your heart you love me, Mary,<br>
Open your arms at last to me."<p>

'Twas pretty to be in Ballinderry<br>
But now it's as sad as sad can be,<br>
For the ship that sailed with Phelim, my diamond,<br>
Is sunk forever beneath the sea.<p>

'Twas pretty to be in Ballinderry,<br>
'Twas pretty to be in Aghalee<br>
Still prettier to be on bonny Ram's Island<br>
Sitting forever beneath a tree.<p>
