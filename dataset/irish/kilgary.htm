<b>
As I was a-walkin' 'round Kilgary Mountain<br>
I met with Captain Pepper as his money he was countin'<br>
I rattled my pistols and I drew forth my saber<br>
Sayin', "Stand and deliver, for I am the bold deceiver."<p>

<i>Chorus<br>
Musha rig um du rum da<br>
Whack fol the daddy o<br>
Whack fol the daddy o<br>
There's whiskey in the jar.<p>
</i>

The shinin' golden coins did look so bright and jolly<br>
I took 'em with me home and I gave 'em to my Molly<br>
She promised and she vowed that she never would deceive me<br>
But the devil's in the women and they never can be easy.<p>

When I was awakened between six and seven<br>
The guards were all around me in numbers odd and even<br>
I flew to my pistols, but alas I was mistaken<br>
For Molly's drawn my pistols and a prisoner I was taken.<p>

They put me into jail without judge or writin'<br>
For robbing Captain Pepper on Kilgary Mountain<br>
But they didn't take my fists so I knocked the sentry down<br>
And bid a fond farewell to the jail in Sligo town.<p>

Now some take delight in fishin' and in bowlin'<br>
And others take delight in carriages a-rollin'<br>
But I take delight in the juice of the barley<br>
And courtin' pretty girls in the morning so early.
