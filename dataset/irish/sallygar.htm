<b>
Down by the salley gardens<br>
My love and I did meet<br>
She passed the salley gardens<br>
With little snow-white feet.<br>
She bid me take love easy<br>
As the leaves grow on the tree<br>
But I, being young and foolish<br>
With her did not agree.<p>

In a field by the river<br>
My love and I did stand<br>
And on my leaning shoulder<br>
She laid her snow-white hand.<br>
She bid me take life easy<br>
As the grass grows on the weirs<br>
But I was young and foolish<br>
And now am full of tears.
