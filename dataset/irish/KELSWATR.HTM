<b>
Here's a health to you, bonnie Kellswater<br>
For it's there you'll find the pleasures of life<br>
And it's there you'll find fishing and farming<br>
And a bonnie wee girl for your wife.<p>

On the hills and the glens and the valleys<br>
Grows the softest of women so fine<br>
And the flowers are all dripping with honey<br>
There lives Martha, a true love of mine.<p>

Bonnie Martha, you're the first girl I courted<br>
You're the one put my heart in a snare<br>
And if ever I should lose you to another<br>
I will leave my Kellswater so fair.<p>

For this one and that one may court her<br>
But no other can take her from me<br>
For I love her as I love my Kellswater<br>
Like the primrose is loved by the bee.<p>

Here's a health to you, bonnie Kellswater<br>
For it's there you'll find the pleasures of life<br>
And it's there you'll find fishing and farming<br>
And a bonnie wee girl for your wife.<p>
