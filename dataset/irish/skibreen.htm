<b>
Oh father dear, I oft-times hear you speak of Erin's isle<br>
Her lofty hills, her valleys green, her mountains rude and wild<br>
They say she is a lovely land wherein a saint might dwell<br>
So why did you abandon her, the reason to me tell.<p>

Oh son, I loved my native land with energy and pride<br>
Till a blight came o'er the praties; my sheep, my cattle died<br>
My rent and taxes went unpaid, I could not them redeem<br>
And that's the cruel reason why I left old Skibbereen.<p>

Oh well do I remember that bleak December day<br>
The landlord and the sheriff came to take us all away<br>
They set my roof on fire with their cursed English spleen<br>
I heaved a sigh and bade goodbye to dear old Skibbereen.<p>

Your mother too, God rest her soul, fell on the stony ground<br>
She fainted in her anguish seeing desolation 'round<br>
She never rose but passed away from life to immortal dream<br>
She found a quiet grave, me boy, in dear old Skibbereen.<p>

And you were only two years old and feeble was your frame<br>
I could not leave you with my friends for you bore your father's name<br>
I wrapped you in my cóta mór in the dead of night unseen<br>
I heaved a sigh and bade goodbye to dear old Skibbereen.<p>

Oh father dear, the day will come when in answer to the call<br>
All Irish men of freedom stern will rally one and all<br>
I'll be the man to lead the band beneath the flag of green<br>
And loud and clear we'll raise the cheer, Revenge for Skibbereen!
