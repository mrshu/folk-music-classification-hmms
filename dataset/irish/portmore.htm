<b>
Oh Bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand<br>
And the more I think on you the more I think long<br>
If I had you now as I had once before<br>
All the Lords in Old England would not purchase Portmore.<p>

Oh Bonny Portmore I am sorry to see<br>
Such a woeful destruction of your ornament tree<br>
For it stood on your shore for many's the long day<br>
Till the long boats of Antrim came to float it away.<p>

All the birds in the forest they bitterly weep<br>
Saying, "Where will we shelter or where will we sleep?"<br>
For the oak and the ash they are all cutten down<br>
And the walls of Bonny Portmore are all down to the ground.<p>

Oh Bonny Portmore, you shine where you stand<br>
And the more I think on you the more I think long<br>
If I had you now as I had once before<br>
All the Lords in Old England would not purchase Portmore.
