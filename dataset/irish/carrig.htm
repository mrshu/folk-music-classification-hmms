<b>

I wish I was in Carrigfergus<br>

Only for nights in Ballygrant<br>

I would swim over the deepest ocean<br>

The deepest ocean for my love to find<br>

But the sea is wide and I cannot cross over<br>

And neither have I the wings to fly<br>

I wish I could meet a handsome boatsman<br>

To ferry me over, to my love and die.<p>



My childhood days bring back sad reflections<br>

Of happy times I spent so long ago<br>

My boyhood friends and my own relations<br>

Have all passed on now like melting snow.<br>

But I'll spend my days in endless roaming<br>

Soft is the grass, my bed is free.<br>

Ah, to be back now in Carrigfergus<br>

On that long road down to the sea.<p>



But in Kilkenny, it is reported<br>

On marble stones there as black as ink<br>

With gold and silver I would support her<br>

But I'll sing no more 'till I get a drink.<br>

For I'm drunk today, and I'm seldom sober<br>

A handsome rover from town to town<br>

Ah, but I'm sick now, my days are numbered<br>

Come all you young men and lay me down.</p>
