<b>
I have seen the lark soar high at morn<br>
Heard his song up in the blue<br>
I have heard the blackbird pipe his note<br>
The thrush and the linnet too<br>
But there's none of them can sing so sweet<br>
My singing bird as you.<p>

If I could lure my singing bird<br>
From his own cozy nest<br>
If I could catch my singing bird<br>
I would warm him on my breast<br>
For there's none of them can sing so sweet<br>
My singing bird as you.
