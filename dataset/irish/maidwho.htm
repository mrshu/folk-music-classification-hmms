<b>
It's cold and raw, the north winds blow<br>
Black in the morning early<br>
When all the hills were covered with snow<br>
Oh then it was winter fairly.<br>
As I was riding o'er the moor<br>
I met a farmer's daughter<br>
Her cherry cheeks and coal-black hair<br>
They caused my heart to falter.<p>

I bowed my bonnet very low<br>
To let her know my meaning.<br>
She answered with a courteous smile<br>
Her looks they were engaging.<br>
"Where are you bound my pretty maid<br>
It's now in the morning early?"<br>
The answer that she gave to me<br>
"Kind sir, to sell my barley."<p>

"Now twenty guineas I've in my purse<br>
And twenty more that's yearly.<br>
You need not go to the market town<br>
For I'll buy all your barley.<br>
If twenty guineas would gain the heart<br>
Of the maid I love so dearly<br>
All for to tarry with me one night<br>
And go home in the morning early."<p>

As I was riding o'er the moor<br>
The very evening after<br>
It was my fortune for to meet<br>
The farmer's only daughter.<br>
Although the weather being cold and raw<br>
With her I thought to parlay<br>
The answer that she gave to me<br>
"Kind sir, I've sold my barley."
