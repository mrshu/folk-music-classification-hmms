<b>
Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling<br>
From glen to glen, and down the mountain side<br>
The summer's gone, and all the flowers are dying<br>
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bide.<p>

But come ye back when summer's in the meadow<br>
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow<br>
'Tis I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow<br>
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so.<p>

And if you come, when all the flowers are dying<br>
And I am dead, as dead I well may be<br>
You'll come and find the place where I am lying<br>
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.<p>

And I shall hear, tho' soft you tread above me<br>
And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be<br>
If you'll not fail to tell me that you love me<br>
I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.<p>

I'll simply sleep in peace until you come to me.
