<b>
Oh list' to the tale of a poor Irish harper<br>
And scorn not the string of his old withered hands<br>
But remember those fingers they once could move sharper<br>
To raise up the strains of his dear native land.<p>

It was long before the shamrock, dear isle's lovely emblem<br>
Was crushed in its beauty by the Saxon's lion paw<br>
And all the pretty colleens around me would gather<br>
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh.<p>

How I love to muse on the days of my boyhood<br>
Though four score and three years have fled by them<br>
It's king's sweet reflection that every young joy<br>
For the merry-hearted boys make the best of old men.<p>

At a fair or a wake I would twist my shillelah<br>
And trip through a dance with my brogues tied with straw<br>
There all the pretty maidens around me would gather<br>
Call me their bold Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh.<p>

In truth I have wandered this wide world over<br>
Yet Ireland's my home and a dwelling for me<br>
And, oh, let the turf that my old bones shall cover<br>
Be cut from the land that is trod by the free.<p>

And when Sergeant Death in his cold arms doth embrace<br>
And lull me to sleep with old Erin go bragh<br>
By the side of my Kathleen, my dear pride, oh place me<br>
Then forget Phelim Brady, the Bard of Armagh.
