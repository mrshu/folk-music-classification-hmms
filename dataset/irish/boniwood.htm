<b>
Down by the green bushes of Bonnie Woodgreen<br>
Where me and my true love so oftimes have been<br>
As the days they rolled onward so happy were we<br>
Ah, but never she thought that a soldier I'd be.<p>

It was early one morning as the lambs they did play<br>
'Twas off to Kells Barracks, I there made my way<br>
To enlist in the army and fight for my King<br>
And I bid my farewell to Bonnie Woodgreen.<p>

Our ship at Larne Harbour sat ready to sail<br>
And mothers were weeping and sisters looked pale<br>
There was singing and dancing all happy and gay<br>
Ah, but little they thought of the lads far away.<p>

It was 'way out in Flanders at the back of the line<br>
They were talking of sweethearts they all left behind<br>
When one Irish soldier says, "I have a queen,<br>
And she works in John Ross' of Bonnie Woodgreen."<p>

It was early one morning while facing the foe<br>
A shot from the enemy this young lad laid low<br>
He called for his comrades, it was a sad scene<br>
"Say good-bye to my Nellie and Bonnie Woodgreen."<p>

So if ever to Ulster you chance for to stray<br>
There's a neat little fact'ry near Ballynafeigh(?)<br>
Where there's weavers and winders all rosy and clean<br>
And they all wear white aprons in Bonnie Woodgreen.
