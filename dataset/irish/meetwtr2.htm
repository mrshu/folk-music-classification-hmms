<b>
There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet<br>
As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet<br>
Oh! The last rays of feeling and life must depart<br>
Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my heart<br>
Ere the bloom of that valley shall fade from my heart.<p>

Yet it was not that nature had shed o'er the scene<br>
Her purest of crystal and brightest of green<br>
'Twas not her soft magic of streamlet or hill<br>
Oh, no! It was something more exquisite still<br>
Oh, no! It was something more exquisite still.<p>

'Twas that friends, the belov'd of my bosom were near<br>
Who made every dear scene of enchantment more dear<br>
And who felt how the best charms of nature improve<br>
When we see them reflected from looks that we love<br>
When we see them reflected from looks that we love.<p>

Sweet vale of Avoca! How calm could I rest<br>
In thy bosom of shade, with the friends I love best<br>
Where the storms that we feel in this cold world should cease<br>
And our hearts, like thy waters, be mingled in peace<br>
And our hearts, like thy waters, be mingled in peace.
