<b>
One morning early I walked forth<br>
By the margin of Lough Leane<br>
The sunshine dressed the trees in green<br>
And summer bloomed again<br>
I left the town and wandered on<br>
Through fields all green and gay<br>
And whom should I meet but a colleen sweet<br>
At the dawning of the day.<p>

No cap or cloak this maiden wore<br>
Her neck and feet were bare<br>
Down to the grass in ringlets fell<br>
Her glossy golden hair<br>
A milking pail was in her hand<br>
She was lovely, young and gay<br>
She wore the palm from Venus bright<br>
By the dawning of the day.<p>

On a mossy bank I sat me down<br>
With the maiden by my side<br>
With gentle words I courted her<br>
And asked her to be my bride<br>
She said, "Young man don't bring me blame"<br>
And swiftly turned away<br>
And the morning light was shining bright<br>
At the dawning of the day.
