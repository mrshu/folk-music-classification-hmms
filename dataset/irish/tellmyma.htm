<i>Chorus<br>
I'll tell my ma when I go home<br>
The boys won't leave the girls alone<br>
They pulled my hair, they stole my comb<br>
But that's all right till I go home.<br>
She is handsome, she is pretty<br>
She is the bell of Belfast city<br>
She is counting one, two, three<br>
Please won't you tell me who is she.</i><p>

Albert Mooney says he loves her<br>
All the boys are fighting for her<br>
They knock at the door and they ring at the bell<br>
Sayin' "Oh my true love, are you well?"<br>
Out she comes as white as snow<br>
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes<br>
Old John Murray says she'll die<br>
If she doesn't get the fellow with the roving eye.<p>

<i>Chorus</i><p>

Let the wind and rain and the hail blow high<br>
And the snow come tumblin' from the sky<br>
She's as nice as apple pie<br>
She'll get her own lad by and by.<br>
When she gets a lad of her own<br>
She won't tell her ma when she goes home<br>
Let them all come as they will<br>
For it's Albert Mooney she loves still.<p>

<i>Chorus (twice)</i>
